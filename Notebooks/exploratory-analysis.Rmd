# The Challenge {.unnumbered}

Finance has the responsibility to forecast, plan and allocate resources in order to
successfully deliver the best treatments to our patients.

-   The **first** challenge consist of deliver sales forecast for 2018 per cluster, per
    brand and per month.

-   The **second** challenge is to provide the optimal allocation of their resources
    for the year 2018.

# Executive summary {.unnumbered}


- An extensive exploratory data analysis has been carried out. It starts looking the aggregated levels of the data and, little by little, it focuses on more detailed aspects until it reaches the product level.

- After analyzing the data, it can be concluded that a few products have most of the weight of the portfolio. Therefore, reducing the forecast error on this products will provide better savings to Novartis.

- Different time series models have been evaluated with a holdout split. For every product, the best model has been selected to generate the final forecast. The overall MAPE is 15%.

- To solve the allocation problem, multiple scenarios have been generated in order to find the best combination of investments for 2018.

# Data preparation

All the data was provided in a single Excel file. This file contains for each brand of
products two geographical levels (cluster and country), sales and investments in a monthly
granularity.

Looking at the file, it seems a direct export from their CRM, time series data in wide
format, with the totals of each quarter. This dataset needs some cleaning before starting
to work with it.

```{r import-data, echo=FALSE}
# Load excel file
df_raw <- 
  readxl::read_excel(
    path = file.path(path_data, "Data_Novartis_Datathon-Participants.xlsx"), 
    sheet = "Sheet1",
    skip = 3
  )

# Show first rows and columns
head(df_raw, 5) %>% 
  select(1:8) %>% 
  to_html(digits = 1)
```

The dimensions of the file are:

```{r dimensions-raw}
dim(df_raw)
```

Summary of the provided data:

-   **Cluster** (9): Highest level of geographical break down

-   **Country** (53): Lowest level of geographical break down

-   **Brand Group** (53): A pharmaceutical product

-   **Function** (8): Financial information related to:

    -   **Sales 1**: Gross sales = volume sold \* price
    -   **Sales 2**: Net Sales = *Sales 1* - Revenue deduction/ etc.
    -   **Investment 1-6**: different investment types

Sales data is available from 2012 through 2017, while investments are available through
2018.

```{r collapsible-tree-plot}
collapsibleTree(
  df = df_raw %>% 
    distinct(Cluster, Country, `Brand Group`) %>% 
    mutate(Cluster = fct_relevel(Cluster, paste("Cluster", seq(1, 10)))) %>% 
    arrange(Cluster),
  root = "Total sales", 
  hierarchy = c("Cluster", "Country", "Brand Group"),
  fillByLevel = TRUE, 
  zoomable = FALSE, height = 500, fontSize = 14, width = "100%")
```

## Cleaning up {#clean-headers}

As mentioned before, we are going to clean up the dataset with the following steps:

-   Remove totals of each quarter
-   Rename `Brand Group` to `brand`
-   Convert all headers to lower strings

```{r clean-raw-data-format, echo=TRUE}
df_raw <- df_raw %>% 
  rename(brand = `Brand Group`) %>% 
  select(-contains("...")) %>% 
  set_names(tolower)
```

```{r}
# Show snapshot
head(df_raw, 4) %>% 
  select(1:8) %>% 
  to_html(digits = 1)
```

If we wanted to perform forecasts at the lowest possible level (cluster, country, brand)
how many *SKU* we should have to forecast?

```{r num-of-forecast-at-low-level, echo=FALSE}
n_sku <- df_raw %>% distinct(cluster, brand, country) %>% nrow()
sprintf("There are a total of %d SKU's to forecast", n_sku)
```

## Re-code brands {#recode-brands}

The forecast is only required for the following brands

```{r preparing-groups, echo=TRUE}
data_wide <- df_raw %>% 
  mutate(
    brand = case_when(
      brand %in% "Brand Group 17" ~ "Brand Group 17",
      brand %in% "Brand Group 24" ~ "Brand Group 24",
      brand %in% "Brand Group 30" ~ "Brand Group 30",
      brand %in% "Brand Group 31" ~ "Brand Group 31",
      brand %in% "Brand Group 36" ~ "Brand Group 36",
      brand %in% "Brand Group 41" ~ "Brand Group 41",
      brand %in% paste("Brand Group", c(51, 73, 90)) ~ "Brand Group 51, 73, 90",
      brand %in% paste("Brand Group", c(96, 97)) ~ "Brand Group 96, 97",
      TRUE ~ "Others"
    )
)
```

```{r show-data-preprocessed}
head(data_wide, 6) %>% 
  select(1:8) %>% 
  to_html(digits = 1)
```

After this aggregations, we have:

```{r num-sku-to-forecast}
n_sku <- data_wide %>% distinct(cluster, brand) %>% nrow()
sprintf("There are %d SKU's to forecast", n_sku)
```

## Reshape the data {#reshape-data}

Convert the `data.frame` to long format using `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`. Now, all
the date columns have disappeared and all the dates appear in the `date` column. The data
frame also contains sales and investments columns.

```{r wide-to-long, echo=TRUE}
data_long <- data_wide %>% 
  mutate(
    `function` = `function` %>% str_to_lower() %>% str_replace(" ", "_") 
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(cluster, brand, country, `function`), 
    names_to = "date", 
    values_to = "value",
    names_transform = list(date = ~ parse_date_time(.x, orders = "my") ), 
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = c(cluster, brand, country, date),
    names_from = `function`, 
    names_sort = TRUE,
    values_from = value,
    values_fn = sum
  ) %>% 
  select(cluster:date, starts_with("sales"), starts_with("investment"))
```

```{r reorder-cluster-levels}
# Cluster as factor for better plots
cluster_lvls <- paste("Cluster", seq(1, 10))
data_long <- data_long %>% 
  mutate(cluster = fct_relevel(cluster, cluster_lvls))
```

```{r show-data-long}
head(data_long, 3) %>% 
  to_html(digits = 1) %>% 
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

# Sales Visual Overview

We will start our visual exploration by investigating a number of time series plots on
different aggregation levels. Then, we will continue exploring the relationship of the
sales with their own past sales and the different investment.

```{r plot-aux-functions}
plot_time_series <- function(data, x, y, y_second, ..., line_size = 0.5) {
  
  x <- rlang::enquo(x)
  y <- rlang::enquo(y)
  
  p <- ggplot(data, aes(x = {{ x }}, y = {{ y }}, ...)) +
    geom_line(size = line_size) +
    scale_y_continuous(
      labels = scales::label_number(suffix = "K", scale = 1e-3)
    ) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, colour = NULL)
  
  if (!missing(y_second)) {
    y_second <- rlang::enquo(y_second)
    p <- p +
      geom_line(aes(y = {{ y_second }} ), color = "orange", 
                size = line_size, alpha = 0.5)
  }
  p
}
```

## All aggregate sales

-   The overall sales present an uptrend, specially after 2016.
-   There is a dip in sales in august.

```{r viz-total-sales}
data <- data_long

total_sales <- data %>% 
  filter(date <= last_train) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(sales_1:investment_6), sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

# plot_time_series(total_sales, x = date, y = sales_2) +
#   labs(title = "Total sales")

plot_ly(total_sales, x = ~date, y = ~sales_2, mode = "lines") %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Total sales",
    xaxis = list(
      title = NA_character_,
      type = "date",
      rangeselector = list(
        buttons = list(
          list(
            count = 6,
            label = "6 mo",
            step = "month",
            stepmode = "backward"),
          list(
            count = 1,
            label = "1 yr",
            step = "year",
            stepmode = "backward"),
          list(
            count = 4,
            label = "4 yr",
            step = "year",
            stepmode = "backward"),
          list(step = "all") 
        )
      )
    ),
    yaxis = list(title = NA_character_),
    legend = list(orientation = "h"), 
    autosize = F, width = 700#, height = 400
  )
```

Let's break down the sales into geographies and brands.

## Geography

There are two geographical levels: Cluster and Country.

### Cluster

Highest level of geographical break down

```{r unique-cluster, echo=FALSE}
levels(data$cluster)
```

```{r agg-by-cluster}
palette <- "Set3" #  "Spectral"

by_cluster <- data %>% 
  filter(date <= last_train) %>% 
  group_by(cluster, date) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(sales_1:investment_6), sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Form the image below we can see that how *Cluster 10*, *Cluster 3*, and *Cluster 2* are
the most important ones regarding sales, and *Cluster 7* is the less important. It seems
that there are two groups of clusters, one with the top three and other with the rest of
the clusters.

```{r viz-boxplot-by-clusters}
by_cluster %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(cluster, sales_2), y = sales_2, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = palette) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = "K", scale = 1e-3)
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, colour = NULL, fill = NULL)
```

Let's see how the sales look like in the past. This time we want to explore visually if
some clusters are more trending than others, are stationary or do present seasonal
patterns.

-   *Cluster 4* seems quite seasonal
-   *Cluster 3* is the most trending one. *Cluster 8* and *Cluster 10* also have some
    trend.
-   *Cluster 1*, *5* and *7* are stable, do not increase/decrease over this period.

```{r viz-cluster}
plot_time_series(by_cluster, x = date, y = sales_2, colour = cluster, line_size = 1) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = palette) +
  # facet_wrap(~ cluster, ncol = 3) +
  # labs(title = "Clusters")
  labs(title = NULL)
```

It is interesting to see how some clusters concentrate many countries while others are
simply formed by one. However, despite these differences, the number of brands in all the
countries is 8 or 9 except in *Cluster 7* with 5 brands.

Another way of looking at the data is by it's contribution to the portfolio. How much
weight each country has? Almost 60% of the portfolio belongs to *Clusters 10*, *Cluster 3*
and *Cluster 2*.

-   *Cluster 1* contains most countries, followed by *Cluster 10* and *Cluster 5* with 36,
    6 and 4 countries respectively.

-   *Clusters 2*, *3*, *4*, *7* and *8* only have one country.

```{r summary-stats-by-cluster}
tree_map <- data %>% 
  group_by(cluster) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of countries` = n_distinct(country),
    `Number of brands` = n_distinct(brand),
    Weight = sum(sales_2, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  mutate(Weight = Weight / sum(Weight)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  rename(Cluster = cluster)

tree_map %>% 
    to_html(digits = 2, full_width = FALSE)
```

Another way of looking at this data is with a tree map plot. As bigger the square it is
more contribution to the portfolio they have, and as darker the shade it is, more
countries in each cluster there are.

```{r cluster-treemap}
pointFormatter <- highcharter::JS("function(){
  return '<b>Weight</b>: ' + this.w_text + '<br>' + '<b>Countries</b>: ' + 
  this['Number of countries']
}")

tree_map %>% 
  mutate(w_text = scales::percent(Weight, accuracy = 0.01)) %>%
  hchart("treemap", 
         hcaes(x = Cluster, value = Weight, color = `Number of countries`), 
         name = "Weight") %>% 
  hc_tooltip(pointFormatter = pointFormatter) %>% 
  hc_legend(align = "right", valueDecimals = 0) 
```

### Country

Lowest level of geographical break down

```{r print-number-of-countries}
sprintf("Number of countries: %d", n_distinct(data$country))
```

```{r unique-country, echo=FALSE}
sort(unique(data$country))[1:10]
```

```{r agg-by-country}
by_country <- data %>% 
  filter(date <= last_train) %>% 
  group_by(cluster, country, date) %>% 
  summarise(value = sum(sales_2, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  mutate(cluster = fct_relevel(cluster, cluster_lvls)) %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>% 
  mutate(
    cluster_label = sprintf("%s (n=%d)", cluster, n_distinct(country)),
    cluster_label = fct_relevel(cluster_label, cluster_lvls)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r top-bottom-countries}
# Calculate top and bottom countries to plot
# them ordered in a boxplot
total_by_country <- by_country %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(total_sales = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE))

n <- 25

# Select top `n` (25)
top_n_ <- total_by_country %>% 
  top_n(total_sales, n = n) %>% 
  pull(country)

# Select bottom `n` (25)
bottom_n_ <- total_by_country %>% 
  top_n(total_sales, n = -n) %>% 
  pull(country)
```

-   Most sales come from few countries
-   There are many countries with very few sales
-   Countries like *Country 25*, *20* or *40* might have outliers. Before treat them as
    such, we should investigate if these values are due to increase/decrease in
    investments, marketing, etc.
-   *Country 40* has high variability, as well as negative sales values.

```{r viz-boxplot-by-country, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
gg_top <- by_country %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_n_) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(country, value), y = value, fill = country)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = palette) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = "K", scale = 1e-3)
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = sprintf("Top %d countries", n), 
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  )

gg_bottom <- by_country %>% 
  filter(country %in% bottom_n_) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(country, value), y = value, fill = country)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = palette) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = "K", scale = 1e-3)
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = sprintf("Bottom %d countries", n), 
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  )

gg_top | gg_bottom
```

All negative sales belong to cluster 1. There are 14 countries with negative values but
without a doubt the most important one is *Country 40* with 52 months with negative sales.

```{r viz-ccountry, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
by_country %>% 
  plot_time_series(x = date, y = value, colour = country) +
  facet_wrap(~ cluster_label, ncol = 3, scales = "free_y") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

In case that we would like to see the 14 countries with negative sales

```{r count-countries-with-negative-sales, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Code to count cluster-countries with negative sales
by_country %>% 
  filter(value < 0) %>% 
  count(cluster, country, sort = TRUE)
```

We confirm that the two biggest countries are *Country 19* and *Country 17*. The same
shade of blue is maintained throughout the matrix, indicating that most countries have the
same number of brands.

```{r country-treemap-data}
tree_map_country <- data %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Number of brands` = n_distinct(brand),
    Weight = sum(sales_2, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  mutate(Weight = Weight / sum(Weight)) %>% 
  rename(Country = country)
```

```{r country-treemap-plot}
pointFormatter <- JS("function(){
  return '<b>Weight</b>: ' + this.w_text + '<br>' + '<b>Brands</b>: ' + 
  this['Number of brands']
}")

tree_map_country %>% 
  mutate(w_text = scales::percent(Weight, accuracy = 0.01)) %>%
  hchart("treemap", 
         hcaes(x = Country, value = Weight, color = `Number of brands`), 
         name = "Weight") %>% 
  hc_tooltip(pointFormatter = pointFormatter) %>% 
  hc_legend(align = "right", valueDecimals = 0)
```

## Brand Group

A Pharmaceutical product

```{r unique-brand, echo=FALSE}
unique(data$brand)
```

```{r agg-by-brand}
by_brand <- data %>% 
  group_by(brand, date) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(sales_1:investment_6), sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

# Save this dataset for later use
write_rds(by_brand, file = file.path(path_data, "data_level_brand.rds"))


by_brand <- by_brand %>% 
  filter(date <= last_train)
```

Brand *Others* is the most significant at the sales level and the one with greatest
dispersion. This can be for all the brands that it groups ([see re-coding
brands](#recode-brands)). On the other hand, *Brand 41*, *Brand 30* and *Brand 36* are the
ones with less dispersion.

```{r viz-most-important-brand}
by_brand %>% 
  filter(date <= last_train) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(brand, sales_2), y = sales_2, fill = brand)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = "K", scale = 1e-3)
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = palette) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, colour = NULL, fill = NULL)
```

Below we can see that:

-   Seven out of nine brands are in an uptrend. *Brand Group 41* and *Others* are the both
    in a downtrend with similar trend structure.
-   *Brand Group 17* and *Brand Group 24* present an exponential trend. Both brands starts
    between 2015 and 2016.
-   *Brand Group 30*, *Brand Group 31* and *Brand Group 51, 73, 90* are in an uptrend up
    to some point in time and then it becomes to remain almost flat for the rest of the
    time.
-   Brand *Others* has dips in august, as does total sales.

```{r viz-brands, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=8}
plot_time_series(by_brand, x = date, y = sales_2, colour = brand) +
  facet_wrap(~ brand, ncol = 3, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = NULL)
```

## All levels

The forecast is required at the Cluster - Brand level. Recall that initially 1184 SKU's
have been provided and after the [aggregation of the series](#recode-brands) we end up
with 75 SKU's.

In this section we will be able to answer question such as: Do the same brand follow the
same pattern despite they do not belong to the same cluster?

```{r agg-at-forecat-level, echo = TRUE}
all_levels <- data %>%
  group_by(cluster, brand, date) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(sales_1:investment_6), sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

# Save this dataset for later use
write_rds(all_levels, file = file.path(path_data, "data_level_sku.rds"))

# Keep only with train data for better visualizations
all_levels <- all_levels %>%
  filter(date <= last_train)
```

With the following code we plot all the brands colored by cluster. However, we will only
plot those cases that have remarkable features.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all_levels %>% 
  plot_time_series(x = date, y = sales_2, colour = cluster) +
  facet_wrap(~ brand, ncol = 3, scales = "fixed")
```

Some brands are more recent than others. *Brand Group 17* and *Brand Group 24* are
examples of recent brands. where they began to be marketed from the beginning and end of
2015 respectively.

```{r viz-brands-1}
all_levels %>% 
  filter(brand %in% c("Brand Group 17", "Brand Group 24")) %>% 
  plot_time_series(x = date, y = sales_2, colour = cluster) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = palette) +
  facet_wrap(~ brand, ncol = 2, scales = "fixed")
```

In the case of *Brand Group 41* we can see a lot of variability within clusters, having in
some clusters values below 10k and in others above 25k. On the other hand, it is
interesting to see how the same brand behaves in a similar way in very cluster. This
indicate us that this could be a good way to train our models.

```{r viz-brands-2}
all_levels %>% 
  filter(brand %in% c("Brand Group 41", "Brand Group 96, 97")) %>% 
  plot_time_series(x = date, y = sales_2, colour = cluster) +
  facet_wrap(~ brand, ncol = 2, scales = "fixed")
```

We can also analyze the contribution of each product in the portfolio. More than 75% of
the products have a weight less than or equal to 2%, while the other 25% have a weight
bigger than 2%. We can also see how around 12% (9 products) of the products have a weights
greater than 4%. This suggests that we should put more focus into some products than
others.

```{r viz-ecdf-products}
all_levels_wgts <- all_levels %>% 
  group_by(cluster, brand) %>% 
  summarise(weight = sum(sales_2)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(weight = weight / sum(weight)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(weight))

ggplot(all_levels_wgts, aes(weight)) +
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.02, lty = 2, color = "grey50") +
  geom_rect(
    xmin = 0, xmax = 0.02, 
    ymin = 0, ymax = Inf, 
    fill = "lightgrey", 
    alpha = 0.01
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "label", x = 0, y = 1, 
    label = "Products with \nweight <= 2%", 
    hjust = -0.1, vjust = 1, 
    size = 4
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.04, lty = 2, color = "grey50") +
  geom_rect(
    xmin = 0.04, xmax = Inf,
    ymin = 0, ymax = Inf,
    fill = "lightgrey",
    alpha = 0.01
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "label", x = 0.05, y = 0.6, 
    label = "Products with weight >= 4%", 
    hjust = 0, vjust = 1, 
    size = 4
  ) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step") +
  
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Weight", y = "Cumulative density")
```

Finally, we can visualize a tree map of the weights of each product. Notice how most
important products belong to *Others* and *Brand Group 41*. Bigger squares and darker
color means higher contribution to the portfolio.

```{r all-levels-treemap-plot}
pointFormatter <- JS("function(){
  return '<b>Weight</b>: ' + this.w_text
}")

all_levels_wgts %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = weight, n = 25) %>% 
  mutate(
    id = paste(cluster, brand, sep = "<br>"),
    w_text = scales::percent(weight, accuracy = 0.01)
  ) %>% 
  hchart("treemap", 
         hcaes(x = id, value = weight, color = weight), 
         name = "Weight") %>% 
  hc_tooltip(pointFormatter = pointFormatter) %>%
  hc_legend(align = "right", valueDecimals = 0)
```

## Lagged sales

Many times the impact of the immediate past sales is not representative of what will come
next. Imagine that we want to predict the temperature that we will have in august in an
specific country. It would make sense to look at the past Augusts and see what is the
average temperature rather than looking at the temperature of April or June.

On the x-axis is represented the lagged value of the sales and in the y-axis the real
value. As closer the points are to the diagonal line better the correlation it is. Last
year sales (12 months) seems a good predictor of current sales.

```{r aux-function-create-lags}
get_lags <- function(var, n = 3){
  var <- enquo(var)
  indices <- seq_len(n)
  map(indices, ~ quo(lag(!!var, !!.x)) ) %>% 
    set_names(sprintf("lag_%s_%02d", rlang::quo_text(var), indices))
}
```

```{r add-sales_2-lags}
total_sales_lags <- total_sales %>% 
  transmute(sales_2, 
    across(.cols = sales_2, .fns = get_lags(sales_2, 12), .names = "{fn}")
  )

plot_data <- total_sales_lags %>% 
  select(
    sales_2, lag_sales_2_03, lag_sales_2_03, lag_sales_2_09, 
    lag_sales_2_12
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = contains("lag_"),
    names_to = "lag_id",
    values_to = "lag_value"
  )
```

  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = "K", scale = 1e-3)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = "K", scale = 1e-3)

# Investments

Investments

## Overall investments

What is the most important investment type? In absolute terms, the most important
investment are *investment_1* and *investment_2*.

```{r}
total_sales %>% 
  select(-starts_with("sales")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("investment"), 
    names_to = "investment", 
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = investment, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE, fill = "gray", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = "K", scale = 1e-3)
  ) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Investment quantity")
```

## Sales vs Investments

To see the relationships between sales and investments, we can plot each time series
against the others. These plots can be arranged in a scatterplot matrix, using the
`GGally` package.

In this plot, mostly negative relationships with *sales_2* are revealed, with the
strongest relationships being with *investment_1* and *investment_5* and the weakest with
*investment_4*.

-   *Investments 1*, *5* and 6 are highly correlated with *sales_2*
-   *Investments 1*, 5and *6* are highly correlated between them. Be cautious when
    modeling!
-   *Investment 3* has an outlier on the left tail of the distribution.
-   *Investment 4* does not have any effect over *sales_2*

Three out of six investments have a negative trend, therefore, it indicates that more and
more has been invested. Recall that investments are negative and lower investments means
more investing.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
total_sales %>% 
  select(date, sales_2, investment_1, investment_5, investment_6) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, scale) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("investment")) %>% 
  plot_time_series(x = date, y = sales_2, y_second = value) +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "fixed") +
  scale_y_continuous()
```

On the other hand, there is another group of investments that are stationary, that is,
they are moving around their mean. In addition, *investment_2* has annual seasonality,
with spikes in august and September and valleys in December.

In January of 2016 there is an outlier in the *investment_3*.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
total_sales %>% 
  select(date, sales_2, investment_2, investment_3, investment_4) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, scale) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("investment")) %>% 
  plot_time_series(x = date, y = sales_2, y_second = value) +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "fixed") +
  scale_y_continuous()
```

## Lagged Investments

Sometimes, the impact of a predictor that is included in a regression model will not be
simple and immediate. For example, an advertising campaign may impact sales for some time
beyond the end of the campaign, and sales in one month will depend on the advertising
expenditure in each of the past few months.
